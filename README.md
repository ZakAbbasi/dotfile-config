This is my Hyprland Arch Config. I am just getting started so I haven't learnt any scripting yet.
To use this config, install GNU Stow, and run it with the appropriate config as such:

`stow <dir-name>`

## TO-DO LIST

### NVIM

- [x] setting up treesitter, fuzzy-finder, auto-cmp
    - [ ] configuring keymaps for esier navigation
    - [ ] setting up Godot to run with nvim

### HYPRLAND

- [ ] styling Hypridle and Hyprlock to be more fleshed out
- [ ] adding audio effects to user input
